1. What did you hope to learn but did not?
    Some common technologies like JQuery or Angular
2. What did you enjoy learning about?
    Building react app was really fun. It was hard in the beginning but when it
    makes sense, it's a lot easier to build than the previous assignments.
3. What worked well in the course?
    I like how the course covered a lot of materials. It introduced me a lot of new
    concepts.
4. What didn't work well in the course?
    I think the grading scheme should be reviewed. For example, for students who
    get 90% inclass exercises requirements correct and 1% of the requirements 
    correct, there should be a difference on the grade to reflect that. 
    Demerits is also really concerning. From the react assignment, demerits sum is a
    lot more than the merits sum. I think it's a good idea to enforce good coding
    style but there should be better ways to design the grading to incentivize it. 
5. What could I have done to help you more?
    I think all assignments except for HW5 have very clear rubric. HW5's requirements
    on testing is very ambiguous. That can be improved. 
    Also, a different classroom will be helpful.
