These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?

These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\",\n\t\t\t\"author\": \"Alice\",\n\t\t\t\"timestamp\": \"977619133830\",\n\t\t\t\"image\": \"http://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/gallery/30-impossibly-cute-puppies/impossibly-cute-puppy-11.jpg\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"following\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"id\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Jane\",\n\t\t\t\"text\": \"Hello\",\n\t\t\t\"image\": \"http://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/gallery/30-impossibly-cute-puppies/impossibly-cute-puppy-1.jpg\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"id\": 1,\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"John\",\n\t\t\t\"text\": \"Hi\",\n\t\t\t\"image\": \"http://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/gallery/30-impossibly-cute-puppies/impossibly-cute-puppy-4.jpg\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"id\": 2,\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"Jack\",\n\t\t\t\"text\": \"What's up\",\n\t\t\t\"image\": \"http://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/gallery/30-impossibly-cute-puppies/impossibly-cute-puppy-6.jpg\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"profAccount\": {\n\t\t\"name\": \"Leebs\",\n\t\t\"email\": \"leebs@rice.edu\",\n\t\t\"phone\": \"7133480000\",\n\t\t\"bday\": \"01-01-1912\",\n\t\t\"zipcode\": \"77005\"\n\t}\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/initialState.json\n// module id = 187\n// module chunks = 0","var Symbol = require('./_Symbol'),\n    getRawTag = require('./_getRawTag'),\n    objectToString = require('./_objectToString');\n\n/** `Object#toString` result references. */\nvar nullTag = '[object Null]',\n    undefinedTag = '[object Undefined]';\n\n/** Built-in value references. */\nvar symToStringTag = Symbol ?
